# Introduction To Virtualization

In this article, I hope to show you the basics of virtualization summarized in one place, in the recent time I searched for a new research topic and it came to my mind that I don't know very much about virtualization and about what goes on when I turn on my ubuntu VM in VMware Workstation.

First Iâ€™ll go through why we would want to use it, some history about the topic, the different types of virtualization and hypervisors, and a couple of techniques for efficient virtualization and to sum up, a little about memory virtualization.
